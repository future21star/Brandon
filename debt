
-All static pages should use the same controller....or no controller at all, look how the error pages work
-post-purchase bid creation needs to be batched if we provide the option of "bulk orders"
-On registration if there is an error, the url changes and if you refresh you get a routing error
-fog is uploading files into directories, we are only storing the file names, not the paths
-Process that takes files from the servers directory and uploads them to the third party host and removes them from local space



TODO
=========
-Admin list version of objects on lookup. Ability to "reify" them

-remove most destroy actions

-Suggest a tag feature
-API calls that fail strong params check need to throw errors, currently send a 200 back
-Tape measurements are in fractions....we should support fractions for measurements
-Use paperclip to upload to S3, remove fog.

-Weird problem when you reset/recreate the test database a bunch of tests from the commandline fail the first time but run fine every
    subsequent run


==================
Testing gotchas
==================
1) React framework deprecated some core functionality in the libraries so the console in development fills with these warnings:
    "application.self-880ce16â€¦.js?body=1:3260 Warning: You are manually calling a React.PropTypes validation function for the `debug`
    prop on `Waypoint`. This is deprecated and will not work in the next major version. You may be seeing this warning due to a third-party
    PropTypes library. See https://fb.me/react-warning-dont-call-proptypes for details."
2) There is a problem with our picture handling so you will notice all images turn into 404 errors at certain points. This on the list of
    things I need to investigate and fix.
3) Weird problem when you reset/recreate the test database a bunch of tests from the commandline fail the first time but run fine every
      subsequent run
4) If you change routes and you are using Routes in your UI code, you must stop the server, clear the cache via "rake tmp:cache:clear" and
    restart the server in order for js-routes to pick up the change.
5)
